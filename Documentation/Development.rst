Coding Standards

We are currently trying to update our code to comply with `python PEP 8 coding standards <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_, with a line length limit of 100.

Any modified and newly written code should comply with this coding standard

The PEP 8 code checker can be installed using::

  sudo apt-get install pep8

Run the checks using::
