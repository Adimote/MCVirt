== Building the package ==

 * Ensure that 'dpkg' and 'svn' packages are installed on the machine
 * Check out the root of the branch/tag/branch of McVirt
 * From within the root of the working copy, run [source:/mcvirt/trunk/build.sh]

== Install Operating System ==

 * McVirt is currently build to support Ubuntu 14.04 with native version of dependencies.
 * When installing the operating system create the following logical volumes:
   * Root - Create a 50GB partition using ext4. This is used for the operating system, McVirt configurations and ISO images
   * SWAP - leave the suggested SWAP volume unaltered

== Installing Package ==

 * Puppet is used install the McVirt package and other tools used on the system. To install puppet, please see wiki:Puppet#Installation
 * The McVirt package is retrieved from the Ubuntu repository on orion.

== Configure Network ==

=== Remove default network ===

 * By default, libvirt configures a default network, 'default'.
 * This should be removed by performing the following:
{{{
sudo mcvirt network delete default
}}}

=== Creating/Removing Network ===

 * Networks provide bridges between physical interfaces and virtual machines.
 * To create a network on the host, as a superuser perform the following:
{{{
sudo mcvirt network create <Network name> --interface <Physical interface>
}}}
 * Assuming that there are not any VMs connected to a network, they can be removed using:
{{{
sudo mcvirt network delete <Network name>
}}}

== Configure McVirt ==

 * The first time McVirt is run, it creates a configuration file for itself, found in '''/var/lib/mcvirt/config.json'''.
 * Set the volume group for the VMs to be stored in, within the configuration file.
