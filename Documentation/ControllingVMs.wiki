= Controlling VMs =

 * All commands must be performed on the McVirt host, which can be accessed via SSH using LDAP credentials.

== Start VM ==

 * Use the McVirt utility to start VMs:
{{{
mcvirt start <VM name>
}}}

== Stop VM ==

 * Use the McVirt utility to stop VMs:
{{{
mcvirt stop <VM name>
}}}

== Reset VM ==

 * Use virsh to reset VMs:
{{{
virsh reset <VM Name>
}}}

== Connect to VNC ==

 * By default, VMs are started with a VNC console, for which the port is automatically generated.
 * The default listening IP address is 127.0.0.1, meaning that it can only be accessed from the host itself.
 * To gain access to a VNC console, ssh to the host, forwarding the port:
   1. Determine the port that the VM is listening on:
{{{
virsh vncdisplay <VM Name>
127.0.0.1:4
}}}
   1. SSH onto the host, calculating the port to forward as 5900 + the port provided in the previous step (in this case, 4, meaning that the port to fowrad would be 5904)
     * The local port can be any available port. In this example, 1232 is used:
{{{
ssh <Username>@<Node> -L 1232:127.0.0.1:5904
}}}
   1. Use an VNC client to connect to 127.0.0.1:1232 on your local PC

== Removing VNC display ==

 * By disabling the VNC display, a greater VM performance may be achieved.
 * Power off the VM
 * Perform:
{{{
virsh edit <VM Name>
}}}
 * Remove the <display type='vnc'... /> line from the configuration.
 * Save the configuration and start the VM

== Monitoring Resources ==

 * To monitor resources, the following commands are available that can be run from an SSH console:
   * top - monitor CPU/memory usages by processes
   * iftop - monitor network usage
   * iotop - monitor disk usages
