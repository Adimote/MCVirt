= Controlling VMs =

 * All commands must be performed on the McVirt host, which can be accessed via SSH using LDAP credentials.

== Start VM ==

 * Use the McVirt utility to start VMs:
{{{
mcvirt start <VM name>
}}}

== Stop VM ==

 * Use the McVirt utility to stop VMs:
{{{
mcvirt stop <VM name>
}}}

== Reset VM ==

 * Use virsh to reset VMs:
{{{
virsh reset <VM Name>
}}}

== Get VM information ==

 * In order to view information about a VM, use the 'info' parameter for McVirt:
{{{
mcvirt info <VM Name>
}}}
 * Example output:
{{{
<Username>@host:~# mcvirt info test-vm
Name              | test-vm
CPU Cores         | 1
Memory Allocation | 512MB
State             | Running
ISO location      | /var/lib/mcvirt/iso/ubuntu-12.04-server-amd64.iso
-- Disk ID --     | -- Disk Size --

-- Group --       | -- Users --
owner             | mc
user              | nd
}}}

== Listing virtual machines ==

 * In order to list the virtual machines on a host, run the following:
{{{
mcvirt list
}}}
 * This will provide the names of the virtual machines and their current state (running/stopped)

== Connect to VNC ==

 * By default, VMs are started with a VNC console, for which the port is automatically generated.
 * The default listening IP address is 127.0.0.1, meaning that it can only be accessed from the host itself.
 * To access VNC, using the connect_vnc.pl script:
{{{
connect_vnc.pl <VM Name>
Username: <Username>
Password:
}}}
 * To manually gain access to a VNC console, ssh to the host, forwarding the port:
   1. Determine the port that the VM is listening on:
{{{
mcvirt info <VM Name> --vnc-port
5904
}}}
   1. SSH onto the host, calculating the port to forward as the port provided in the previous step (in this case, 4, meaning that the port to fowrad would be 5904)
     * The local port can be any available port. In this example, 1232 is used:
{{{
ssh <Username>@<Node> -L 1232:127.0.0.1:5904
}}}
   1. Use an VNC client to connect to 127.0.0.1:1232 on your local PC

== Removing VNC display ==

 * By disabling the VNC display, a greater VM performance may be achieved.
 * Power off the VM
 * Perform:
{{{
virsh edit <VM Name>
}}}
 * Remove the <display type='vnc'... /> line from the configuration.
 * Save the configuration and start the VM

== Monitoring Resources ==

 * To monitor resources, the following commands are available that can be run from an SSH console:
   * top - monitor CPU/memory usages by processes
   * iftop - monitor network usage
   * iotop - monitor disk usages

== Back up VM ==
 * If the VM can be powered off:
   * Power off the VM
   * Login to <Node> as root
   * Ensure the LV of the HDD is active
   * Perform a dd of the HDD to a backup location:
{{{
dd if=/dev/<Node>-vg/mcvirt_vm-test-vm5-disk-1 of=/path/to/backup/location.raw bs=1M
}}}
