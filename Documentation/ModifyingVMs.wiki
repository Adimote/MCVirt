= Modifying VMs =

=== Increase Disk Size ===

 * Power off the VM
 * Perform the following command, adjusting the count (which is the number of Megabytes to add to the disk) and the disk name:
{{{
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1 >> /var/lib/mcvirt/vm/$VM_NAME/vm-<VM Name>-disk-1.raw
}}}

=== Attaching ISO ===

 * ISO images can be attached to the cdrom drive of a VM whilst booting the VM
 * Use the McVirt utility to start the VM, using the '--iso' parameter to define the ISO image to be attached to the VM
{{{
mcvirt start <VM Name> --iso <Name of ISO file>
}}}
 * The VM must be stored within /var/lib/mcvirt/iso and specifying just the filename in the above command.
